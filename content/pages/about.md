# Hi, I'm Bilal Ameen

I am a Digital Product Strategist with 5 years of user-centric
experience at Microsoft. Creating useful and value-adding
solutions using my business and user psychology knowledge is
what I am all about. My experience in Digital Product Strategy,
UX Design, and interpersonal skills makes me a natural facilitator
between users and product teams.



My passion is to build and launch innovative, user-friendly
products in collaboration with business stakeholders, designers,
and developers. My greatest strength is my natural ability to
empathize with and understand customers. I use my insights to
define product visions and contribute to developing products
that support end-user needs while aligning with the business,
project, and design goals.
